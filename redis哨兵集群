###### redis哨兵集群
### For those of you who are impatient, here is the summary of commands we ran in this tutorial:
#### Create a bootstrap master
kubectl create -f examples/staging/storage/redis/redis-master.yaml

#### Create a service to track the sentinels
kubectl create -f examples/staging/storage/redis/redis-sentinel-service.yaml

#### Create a replication controller for redis servers
kubectl create -f examples/staging/storage/redis/redis-controller.yaml

#### Create a replication controller for redis sentinels
kubectl create -f examples/staging/storage/redis/redis-sentinel-controller.yaml

#### Scale both replication controllers
kubectl scale rc redis --replicas=3
kubectl scale rc redis-sentinel --replicas=3

#### Delete the original master pod
#### Note: If you are running all the above commands consecutively including this one in a shell script, it may NOT work out. When you run the above commands, let the pods first come up, especially the redis-master pod. Else, the sentinel pods would never be able to know the master redis server and establish a connection with it.
kubectl delete pods redis-master
